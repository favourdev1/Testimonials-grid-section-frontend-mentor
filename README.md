### What I learned

I learned how to position items better using position:absolute and position: relative.
```css
.quote-img{
    position:absolute;
}
```

it was also cool to find out that i could save some values as variables which could be used later.

```css
:root {
    --moderateviolet: #7541c8;
    --dark-grayish-blue: #48556a;
    --dark-blackish-blue: #19212e;
    --Light-gray: #cfcfcf;
    --Light-grayish-blue: #ecf2f8;
    --normal: 500;
    --bold: 700;
}
```



### Continued development

I'm going to keep  brushing up my skills in css so that i can improve myself better. I'm also going to build more sample projects so i can see my improvements so far.


### Useful resources
