## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I learned how to position items better using position:absolute and position: relative.
```css
.quote-img{
    position:absolute;
}
```

it was also cool to find out that i could save some values as variables which could be used later.

```css
:root {
    --moderateviolet: #7541c8;
    --dark-grayish-blue: #48556a;
    --dark-blackish-blue: #19212e;
    --Light-gray: #cfcfcf;
    --Light-grayish-blue: #ecf2f8;
    --normal: 500;
    --bold: 700;
}
```



### Continued development

I'm going to keep rading up and brushing up my skills in css so that i can improve myself better. I'm also going o build more sample projects so i can see my improvements so far.


### Useful resources
